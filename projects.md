### Other Ongoing Projects

We are currently organizing additional project pages based on our core research themes, including:

- **Wireless RF Fingerprinting and Device Identification**  
  Physical-layer identification and authentication of wireless devices using radiometric fingerprints and deep learning.

- **Cybernetic Avatars and Remote Presence**  
  Human–avatar interaction, security, and privacy for remote work and telepresence scenarios.

- **Edge-centric IoT and Urban Sensing**  
  Intelligent sensing platforms on public vehicles and infrastructure for city-scale data collection and analysis.

Dedicated pages for these projects will be added as they are consolidated.

## Past Projects

We have also conducted a variety of past projects in areas such as:

- Automotive sensing platforms for smart cities  
- Opportunistic urban sensing using public vehicles  
- Throughput and capacity analysis of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs)

Some of these are now integrated into or extended by the current projects above.
