<!-- Optional: a block diagram of your system. -->

- **Input:** What data or signals are used?
- **Processing:** What modules or models are applied?
- **Output:** What does the system produce or enable (recognition, detection, control, etc.)?

### 4.2 Core Methods

Summarize key technical ideas, for example:

- **Signal Processing:** synchronization, channel estimation, feature extraction, etc.
- **Machine Learning / Modeling:** models (CNN, Transformer, AE, etc.), training strategy, loss functions.
- **System Design:** on-device / edge / cloud deployment, latency and resource considerations.

### 4.3 Implementation

Give some implementation details:

- **Hardware:** SDRs, edge devices, robots, sensors, etc.
- **Software:** frameworks and tools (e.g., GNU Radio, PyTorch, ROS, Docker).
- **Deployment:** how the system is integrated (standalone prototype, robot platform, intelligent space, etc.).
